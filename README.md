# rust_workspace

Simple sketchbook of different rust experiments, maybe too small for separate projects

## todo
* Fix the codespace/build to make it easier to quickly lint and rebuild
* devise robust testing methodology instead of matching args in main
* build out arm targeting that doesn't get in the way of being agile
